An extendible implementation of the server-side
[Streamr Protocol](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-specs/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) logic written in TypeScript.
The package mostly acts as a library for other packages wishing to implement a broker node, but additionally
provides a full tracker executable, and a stripped-down network node executable.


The primary executable for running a broker node in the Streamr Network resides in the
[streamr-broker](https://github.com/streamr-dev/broker) package. Although _streamr-network_ contains a
fully-operational minimal network node implementation, we recommend running the node executable found in
_streamr-broker_ as it includes useful client-facing features for interacting with the Streamr Network.

The [wiki](https://github.com/streamr-dev/network/wiki) outlines the technical and architectural
decisions of the project. It provides thorough explanations of some the more involved features.
A glossary is also included.

    LOG_LEVEL=debug

... or adjust debugging to desired level:

    LOG_LEVEL=[debug|info|warn|error]

To disable all logs

    NOLOG=true

### Regenerate self-signed certificate fixture
To regenerate self signed certificate in `./test/fixtures` run:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 36500 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

## Release

Publishing to NPM is automated via Github Actions. Follow the steps below to publish stable (`latest`) or `beta`.

### Publishing stable (latest)
1. `git checkout master && git pull`
2. Update version with either `npm version [patch|minor|major]`. Use semantic versioning
https://semver.org/. Files package.json and package-lock.json will be automatically updated, and an appropriate git commit and tag created.
3. `git push --follow-tags`
4. Wait for Github Actions to run tests
5. If tests passed, Github Actions will publish the new version to NPM

### Publishing beta
1. Update version with either `npm version [prepatch|preminor|premajor] --preid=beta`. Use semantic versioning
https://semver.org/. Files package.json and package-lock.json will be automatically updated, and an appropriate git commit and tag created.
2. `git push --follow-tags`
3. Wait for Github Actions to run tests
4. If tests passed, Github Actions will publish the new version to NPM
